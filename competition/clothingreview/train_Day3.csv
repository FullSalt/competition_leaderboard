at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim","このトレンチは、パソコンの画面で見た瞬間に買わなければならないと思ったのですが、何かのきっかけで近くの小売店に立ち寄り、まず試着してみることにしました。

24,49,Pretty but odd fit,かわいいけど、変なフィット感,"The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly, the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.",ビスコースレーヨンなのにシルクのような素敵な生地で、柄もきれいです。,3,0,General,Dresses,Dresses,0
